## Welcome to Konrad Izykowski's Github Page
Here you can find a brief summary of some of the projects I have on GitHub, linked to their respective repositories, as well as some information about me.

### Beacon
Beacon is an Android app that allows users to spontaneously find events occuring near their location. On each event page users can find more information about the event, as well as comment and share photos. Beacon is meant to encourage people to see what is happening around them and join in.

### DesktopLauncher
The DesktopLauncher is a toy turret that can aim, take photos, and be fired by the user. The DesktopLauncher was created using an FPGA as well as several other hardware components (servos, camera, bluetooth chip, touchscreen). Aside from the controls available on the turretâ€™s touchscreen, users can pair the turret to an Android companion app. This Android app provides all the functionality of the turret alone, and adds several features that make it even more fun to play with.
