### [Beacon](https://github.com/lsaccoz/Beacon)
Beacon is an Android app that allows users to spontaneously find events occuring near their location. On each event page users can find more information about the event, as well as comment and share photos. Beacon is meant to encourage people to see what is happening around them and join in.
